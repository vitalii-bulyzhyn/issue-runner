# Issue runner

This is a plugin that allows you to move back and forth on GitHub issues without returning to the list page. You can install plugin to your Chrome [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/issue-runner/ajfkfhmfjnpnmpdlcffmnidebpfhlpke?hl=ru&authuser=0). To see how it works, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJWWPb9e7ts)

## Development

1. Clone the repo
2. Go to your chrome and [extensions panel](chrome://extensions/) and activate "Developer mode" (on the top right corner)
3. Click "Load unpacked" on the top left corner and import extension
4. You are are ready to go

## Future development
There are few thing that to be added:
1. For now it's limited only to 100 issues that you can switch with this (even less, because GitHub treats PRs as issues), so need to make it work without this limitation
2. Add support for GitLab and BitBucket (if you really need this - feel free to send a PR)

## Contribution
If  something doesn't work or you see the way it can be improved, feel free to open Issue or send a PR
